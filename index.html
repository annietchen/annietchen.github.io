                            <li>Research infrastructures for interpretation</li>
                            <li>Social media research</li>
                            <li>Understanding consumer behavior through online methods</li>
                            <li>Patient and/or caregiver experience of specific conditions/disorders/contexts (fibromyalgia, substance use, dementia, mental health)</li>

                        <h2>Teaching</h2>
                        <p>I teach courses on topics relating to consumer health informatics, user-centered and stakeholder-engaged design, and research methods. Though the courses I teach span a variety of modalities (in-person and virtual, synchronous and asynchronous), they include common threads:

                        <ul><li><em>Hands-on, real-world experience.</em> My courses will involve projects that mentored by sponsors in different contexts, including clinical care, informatics, assisting living and retirement communities, software companies, academic laboratories, and more.</li>
                            <li><em>Discursive design.</em> You bring the value! You and your colleagues benefit due to the contributions that each person makes. This may involve online discussion, in-class discussion, student presentations, and interactive group activities.</li>
                            <li><em>Teamwork.</em> Courses afford opportunities for students to engage in collaborative work with others. These experiences can not only lead to valuable experiences for working on larger projects, but also perhaps catalyze lasting relationships with future collaborators!</li>
                            <li><em>Agency.</em> Through participation, students have the ability to shape the content towards their interests. Take one to find out how this works.
                        </ul>

                        <p>Courses currently taught at the University of Washington:</p>

                        <ul><li>BIME 543, Consumer Health and Informatics</li>
                            <li>BIME 554, Biomedical Information Interactions and Design</li>
                            <li>NMETH 530, Scholarly Proposal Development</li>
                        </ul>
